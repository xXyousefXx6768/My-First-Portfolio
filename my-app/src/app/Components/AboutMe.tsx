            ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yousef Amr, also known as Tito â€” a passionate Full-Stack Developer who loves turning ideas into interactive, functional, and visually appealing web experiences.
Iâ€™m currently studying at Al-Alsun, Ain Shams University, majoring in Italian, English, and German, which gives me a unique ability to connect with people from different cultures and think creatively in multiple languages.
ðŸ’» Iâ€™ve completed an online internship with Neuronetix, where I worked on real-world frontend projects and gained hands-on experience with modern technologies like React, Laravel, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and Framer Motion.
What drives me the most is problem-solving â€” I enjoy building efficient, clean, and user-friendly solutions from scratch.
I also love experimenting with animations and UI effects that bring life to web interfaces.
ðŸš€ My goal is to keep improving my skills every day and collaborate on projects that make an impact, blending creativity with logic to build something meaningful.
When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me watching hacker movies, exploring new tech trends, or learning new languages.
          </p>
